# TASK-2-ELEVATE-LABS
üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Summary
This project involves performing comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to uncover insights, detect patterns, and understand the underlying structure of the data. The EDA process is an essential first step in any data-driven project, helping to guide feature selection, preprocessing, and model development.

üîç Key Tasks Performed
Summary Statistics
We begin by calculating descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for all numerical features. These metrics provide a quick overview of central tendencies, spread, and potential skewness in the data.

Visualizations: Histograms & Boxplots
Histograms are plotted to visualize the distribution of each numeric variable, helping identify skewed distributions or multimodal behavior. Boxplots complement this by showcasing the spread, median, and presence of outliers in the data.

Pairplot and Correlation Matrix
We generate a pairplot to examine pairwise relationships between features, which helps in identifying clusters, linear/non-linear patterns, and potential feature redundancy. A correlation matrix heatmap is also created to highlight positively and negatively correlated variables, providing guidance for feature engineering and dimensionality reduction.

Pattern & Anomaly Detection
Through statistical summaries and visual inspection, we identify anomalies, data imbalance, or unexpected trends, which may affect downstream tasks. These findings are crucial for deciding on data cleaning strategies.

Feature-Level Inferences
Based on the visual and statistical analysis, we derive basic insights such as feature skewness, relationships with target variables (if available), and potential candidates for normalization, transformation, or removal.
